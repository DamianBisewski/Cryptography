# Cryptography
Cryptography in Python
This repository will show Python implementations of various ciphers. Currently only block ciphers ECB (Electronic Code Book) and CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) are shown.
The user needs to create a key (16 ASCII chars) and find an image. After running the script with 
```bash python block.py``` the user will be able to understand, why ECB is not
used. CBC is one of the first blockchains (used in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin).
In the future Caesar, affine and Enigma ciphers are to be added.
